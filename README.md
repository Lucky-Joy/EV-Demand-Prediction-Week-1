# EV Demand Prediction using AI

## Overview

This project was completed as part of a 4-week internship under the **Shell-Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Internship Program**. The internship focused on developing **Green Skills using AI technologies** to solve real-world sustainability challenges. Throughout the internship, I worked independently on a complete AI-driven data project, under the guidance of industry mentors.

## Internship Details

* **Internship Name:** Shell-Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Internship
* **Duration:** 15th July 2025 – 16th August 2025
* **Organised by:** Edunet Foundation, AICTE & Shell
* **Theme:** Green Skills using AI
* **Mode:** Remote & Project-based
* **Project Focus:** Predicting Electric Vehicle (EV) Demand

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to build a data-driven solution that predicts **Electric Vehicle (EV) demand** using machine learning. The aim is to support decision-making in green transportation planning by analyzing trends and forecasting demand in a sustainable, data-informed manner.
