# EV Demand Prediction - Week 1 Task

## Overview

This project is a part of **Week 1 deliverable** for my internship under the **Shell-Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Internship Program**. The internship is facilitated by **Edunet Foundation** in collaboration with **AICTE and Shell**, focusing on developing **Green Skills using AI technologies**.

## Internship Details

* **Internship Name:** Shell-Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Internship
* **Duration:** 15th July 2025 – 16th August 2025
* **Organised by:** Edunet Foundation, AICTE & Shell
* **Focus:** Green AI Skills Development
* **Task Type:** Weekly project-based milestones

## Week 1 Objective

The goal for Week 1 was to:

* **Import and Pre-process Data**
* **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* **Visualize Data**
* **Begin Initial Data Modelling (if applicable)**

## Project Description

In this notebook, I worked on predicting **Electric Vehicle (EV) Demand** using the provided dataset. The tasks performed include:

* Loading the **EV Demand Prediction Dataset**
* Cleaning and pre-processing the data
* Generating visualizations to understand patterns and trends
* Preparing data for future predictive modelling tasks

## Files Included

* **EV\_Vehicle\_Week\_1.ipynb** – Jupyter notebook containing all the code and outputs
* **EV Demand Prediction Dataset.csv** – Dataset used for the analysis
* **Offer Letter.pdf** – Internship offer letter for reference

## Tech Stack

* **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**
* **Jupyter Notebook**

## Note

This task is part of an ongoing project which will continue in the following weeks, focusing on building and evaluating machine learning models for EV demand forecasting.
